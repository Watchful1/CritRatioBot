This is a python reddit bot for a small writing commentary subreddit. It keeps track of stories posted and stories commented on and provides a summary of ratios when messaged.

#Setup instructions

Download this code either with the download zip button above or by running "git clone https://github.com/Watchful1/CritRatioBot.git"

This bot uses Oauth to access a reddit account. Follow the instructions here to set it up for your account https://github.com/SmBe19/praw-OAuth2Util/blob/master/OAuth2Util/README.md

The account needs at least 2 or 3 karma to bypass the captcha limits on new accounts.

The first run will take a few minutes for it to search the entire backlog.
